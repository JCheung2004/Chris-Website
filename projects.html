      <h4>Pondside Harmony</h4> 
        <br>
      <p>When staying in a log cabin with my family in Perthshire I recorded a ton of outdoor sounds like flowing water in a stream, flowing water in a river and squirrels/birds flocking to a feeder. Wanted to use some of the best of these under a track, with images of Lord of the Rings style elves meditating around a pond, or something. Recorded a gentle guitar piece and asked Merlie to 'ooh' along to it several times. Each time she wouldn't hear her previous take, with the idea of creating an ethereal choir of her voice, played over a single guitar track. I liked the idea of the voices starting and finished at different times, panning them so it sounds like they're positioned all around. </p>

      <h4>Street Spirit with Specs McCoy and Merlie(Radiohead Cover)</h4> 
        <br>
      <p>Recorded at a friend's house with us both playing simultaneously on two acoustic guitars, both belonging to him. We sat perpendicular with our guitars facing away from each other to have the least interference. While there is definitely some, it doesn't detract from the sound at all. I panned the two recordings hard left & right for that stereo effect and the result is a lovely blend. Most of all I'm surprised that we kept time with one another so effectively throughout such a long song. 
We ran out of time recording all the vocals, so we only have them for half of the track! There is still another guitar part to add and Merlie has said she'd like to finish the vox, so that's still to come. Could definitely do with tidying up the end as well. 
</p>

      <h4>There There with Merlie(Radiohead Cover)</h4> 
        <br>
      <p>Spent a long time on this track trying to recreate that fuzzy guitar sound through the Germanium pedal. Eventually settled on a sound and figured out the bass section too. What you can hear is two guitars and a bass with tripled vocals over the top. Of the three vocal takes we did we couldn't decide on one, and when by accident I played them all at once, we really liked the outcome! Certainly bolsters the voice which may have been necessary on such an energetic song. Simply ran out of time making it and yet to go back. It needs just more of the same and for me to learn all of the sections. I've honestly just been lazy with this one as it requires having the guitar in quite a weird, specific tuning and I can't be bothered!

      <h2>Completed Projects</h2>

      <h4>Careism Part 4</h4> 
        <br>
      <p>Last section of a soundtrack created for a short documentary on discrimination against foster kids (hence the name of the track). This was probably the most interesting part of the completed song. I didn't want to play around with panning in case it was distracting for the viewer, as the documentary was a pair of interviews so the speech needed to take priority. 
I wrote the song on the acoustic guitar, which you can hear underneath the track. The other guitar part was much more interesting and was all created on the Ditto X2 Looper. The song ran at 128 bpm and I was aware I didn't want the guitar lead to sound too energetic or frantic, even. Every phrase I tested out sounded this way so the solution I came up with was to half the speed of the track (to 64 bpm) and to record my guitar lead at half the speed with the Ditto X2's 0.5 speed function active. This meant I could play the lead part right down the neck where I could leave open notes to ring. The result was when I turned off the 0.5 function, it doubled in speed what I had recorded and warped the audio up an octave. Was really pleased with the affected sound and it sounded less bright so didn't dominate the track so much. Made this track at the peak of my dive down the Ditto X2 rabbit hole and it's pretty obvious I think. There's even some reversed guitar at the end.</p>

      <h4>Reckoner with Merlie(Radiohead Cover)</h4> 
        <br>
      <p>First song I recorded with Merlie (girlfriend) as it's her favourite Radiohead song and we'd been playing it together for some time. Recorded simultaneously with the only post-production being to add artificial reverb and a brief harmony. This definitely felt more comfortable for her whereas I'd usually record everything separately to ensure good takes. However, I've never gone back to re-record despite knowing I made mistakes and it wasn't the cleanest take. Something just feels right about leaving the track as it was first conceived. </p>

      <h4>Nude with Merlie(Radiohead Cover)</h4> 
        <br>
      <p>For this cover we recorded the vocals and a guitar part simultaneously very casually and without recording to a click. Oh, the error, as I tried to record the bass and a second guitar part over the top. It resulted in a little bit of a mess timing-wise but I think I managed to patch up most of it. Recording simultaneously does present that restriction as I can't use the condenser on both of us or have the click audible for both of us. I mean, it's preventable so long as I don't play as sloppily as I did, but that's neither here nor there! DI'd the bass on this one and played the lead guitar part on the Wildkat through the Holy Grail. </p>
